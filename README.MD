Move fetches data in realtime from the New York Times, Wikipedia and Google, 
giving you information on a location.
Plugging into the New York Times and Wikipedia API using Ajax, latest news on a specific location is fetched and served.
  The Wikipedia API gives relevant links on the location while the NewYork Times gives the  latest news. .

I also use the Google map API to get a recent picture of the location inputted by the user.
So, essentially, Move is built to help a user decide if making a relocation is actually a wise course 
and to get a pool of relevant resources on the location of choice.
